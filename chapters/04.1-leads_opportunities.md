- Searching Leads

  - The Leads list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Leads list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire MaaxFrame database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that MaaxFrame automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word “smith” in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.

  For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the Search documentation.

- Leads List View

  - The Leads list view displays all lead records meeting the current search criteria to which your user has access. You can view the basic details of each lead within the field columns. Please note that you will only be able to see lead records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the Team Management and Role Management documentation in the Administration guide.

- Leads Record View

 - The Leads record view displays thorough lead information including all lead fields. Beneath the fields you can toggle between viewing a lead's subpanels of related records (Campaigns) and the lead's activity stream. The record view can be reached by clciking a lead record's link from anywhere in the application including from the Leads list view.

 Please note that you will only be able to view a lead record according to your team membership, user type, and role restrictions. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the Team Management and Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the Studio documentation in the Administration guide.

- Deleting Records

 - If a lead record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's MaaxFrame instance, it may be deleted from either the Leads record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting lead records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.

 Please note that your ability to delete leads in MaaxFrame may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Delete options.
