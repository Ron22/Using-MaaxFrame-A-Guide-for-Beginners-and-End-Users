#### Adding Recipients

MaaxFrame, just like many other email clients, allows multiple recipients for a single email. Recipients can be placed in the To, Cc, and Bcc sections. To enable the Cc and Bcc sections simply "Add Cc" or "Add Bcc".

By default, all of these individuals are listed in the address book; however, you can filter the list if you want to view a specific group such as contacts or users. You can also search for an individual by first name, last name, email address, or account name.
