Thank you for using MaaxFrame, the world’s first advertisement driven and subscription based CRM service and
software solutions provider. This is our User’s Manual, which will assist you in using the hosted version of our
software.

Our interface has been designed to make navigation and data entry as simple as possible. We have color-coded our
menu items and our layout and design is simple and intuitive. Our system is a team sales and support tool,
automating many procedures and providing a means of tracking sales and support issues in a collaborative
environment.

The first step to using our software is customizing all of the settings and information for your particular business,
which includes some decisions that you must make before using the software. We have developed a Quick
Start Guide that is valuable for those of you who are already somewhat familiar with CRM software as a hosted
service. Our system is very user friendly, those of you who are Internet savvy and use many web-based applications
such as email or frequently use customer relationship management should be able to get up and going very, very
quickly.
