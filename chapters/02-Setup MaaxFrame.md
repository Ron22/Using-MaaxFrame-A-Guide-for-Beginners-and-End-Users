# Setup MaaxFrame

This section tells you how to take the next steps by outlining the key areas to begin setting up MaaxFrame, including:

* Company profile
* User access and permissions
* Customization
* Adding users
* Importing data

## Set Up Your Company Profile

The company profile information determines basic settings related to time zones, language, and how the fiscal year is defined. You can leave the default settings as is; however, it’s important to know where to find and change this information.

* Company profile – These settings use your local time for setting the time zone, default language, and the default currency.
* Fiscal years – The fiscal year definitions are used in reporting, opportunities, and forecasting. The default fiscal year setting is a 12-month calendar year, with the first day of the fiscal year starting on any first day of the month. However, you can choose custom fiscal year periods.


## Establish User Access and Permissions

There are some key components that determine users’ access to data as well as what they can do with the data they have access to.

### Data Access

When setting up MaaxFrame for the first time, you need to make some decisions about who will have access to what data. In MaaxFrame, there are four ways to control data access:

* ***Organization-wide defaults*** – Configure the baseline access users will have to your data.
* ***Role hierarchy*** – Determine the level of visibility users have to data.
* ***Sharing rules*** – Extend access to data if you’ve restricted access through your organization-wide defaults.
* ***Manual sharing*** – Provide the flexibility to allow record owners to manually give access to other users.

#### Organization-Wide Defaults

These settings, which determine the default level of data access for different types of information, are referred to as “organization wide defaults.” These include:

* ***Private*** – Users can access (view and edit) their information and that of those below them in the role hierarchy.
* ***Public Read Only*** – Users can view all data, but can edit only their information as well as that of those below them in the role hierarchy
* ***Public Read Write*** – Users can view and edit all data

For smaller organizations, we recommend granting at least Public Read Only access to create a collaborative working environment.

Examples:

* To allow all users to see everyone’s accounts, but not everyone’s opportunities, set access for account records to Public Read Only and for opportunity records to Private.
* To allow the operations team to calculate commissions, they need to see opportunities. However, you don’t want them to edit the opportunities. To allow read-only access, set opportunity records to Public Read Only.
* To set up organization-wide-defaults, please refer to our techincal guide.

#### Role Hierarchy

The role hierarchy looks similar to an organization chart, but it has a different purpose. Because the role hierarchy is based on who needs to work with what data to do his or her job, role hierarchies usually have fewer layers and the people at the top are not necessarily those at the top of the org chart.

The person in the top role (i.e Admin) has full access (view ,edit and delete ) to his or her data as well as the data of anyone lower in the hierarchy. Two common ways to set up role hierarchy are by region or by product.

There are three basic steps to setting up a successful role hierarchy:

1. Define the basic roles, such as sales representative, director of sales, and CEO. It’s not necessary to create individual roles for each title; the idea is to simply define a hierarchy that gives users in higher-level roles access to the information entered by users in the lower-level roles.
2. Build the role hierarchy based on how information should roll up for reporting and on who should see what data.
3. Assign individual users to the roles.

### Sharing Rules

Sharing rules let you make automated exceptions to your organization-wide defaults for particular sets of users, so you can give them access to records they don’t own or can’t normally see. Sharing rules, like role hierarchies, are only used to give additional users access to records—they cannot be stricter than your organization-wide default settings.

### Manual Sharing

Sometimes it’s impossible to define a consistent group of users who need access to a particular set of records. In those situations, record owners can use manual sharing to give read and edit permissions to users who would not normally have access to the record. Although manual sharing isn’t automated like sharing rules, it gives record owners the flexibility to share particular records with users that need to see them.

#### Permissions

Profiles control what users have permission to do with the data they have access to, and how they view the information.Please refer to our technical guide.

#### Understand Profiles

A profile is a collection of settings and permissions that defines how users with particular profile access records, how they see their data, and what they can do within the application. For MaaxFrame Premium Editions, you can use the standard MaaxFrame profiles but you can’t create custom profiles. Even so, it’s important to understand profiles and how they work together with the organization-wide defaults and the role hierarchy. The most important profiles include:

* System Administrator – Can configure and customize the application
* Standard User – Can run reports and create and edit records
* Read Only – Can run and export reports and view—but not edit—records

When you add users as you prepare to go live, you will assign one of these profiles to each user.

## Customization

When you sign on with MaaxFrame, it’s ready to use as is. But you can also easily modify MaaxFrame so that it’s an even better fit for your business and your users. In fact, the more you customize the application to fit your specific users, the more comfortable they’re likely to be—and customization can do great things to boost your adoption rates.

### Use Customization Tips & Tricks

Customizing MaaxFrame is so easy that there’s a tendency to create lots of fields that end up not being used. For that reason, it’s important to take a step back before you dive in.

Here are the top five things to think about before starting to customize:

* ***Think before you build*** – Start with the end in mind by identifying your end goal. Think about what information you want to pull out of the system, and then make sure you have the fields to match. At the end of the day, MaaxFrame is only as good as what’s in your reports.

* ***Ask for input*** – Talk to your users to find out what’s critical for them to know. Then capture that information to run your business.

* ***Seed and grow*** – Start with the basic fields you need and then identify new fields that could make your business run even better. This approach ensures you don’t turn off your users.

* ***Run reports*** – Run reports about one month after you go live to find out which fields are not being used. Use the opportunity to survey users about what could be improved.

* ***Make changes on the fly*** – In response to feedback, make changes immediately to gain instant credibility. Make sure you communicate any changes, because users don’t like it when anything that affects their work happens “magically.”
