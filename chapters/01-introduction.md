# Introduction

One of the best investments you can make in your MaaxFrame success is to have a clear plan. Just as you wouldn’t build a house without a blueprint, you don’t want to start using MaaxFrame without a plan. A plan will help you to communicate with everyone, to do things in the right order, identify key resources, and keep a clear end date in mind.

As you plan and prepare to get MaaxFrame up and running, complete the following steps:

* Build your team
* Define your company’s vision
* Define and prioritize your goals
* Develop your rollout plan
* Define key aspects of your process and diagram the process flow
* Map your process to MaaxFrame functionality
* Decide which reports you need
* Train your administrator
* Communicate with your end users

### Build Your Team

To a small business with limited resources, the term “project team” may sound intimidating, but it doesn’t take a huge team to implement MaaxFrame. You just need to cover the following key roles (and the same person can cover more than one role):

* An executive sponsor
* A project owner to get the application up and running
* An administrator to manage MaaxFrame day to day
* A power user who really knows your company’s business processes

The **executive sponsor** lends his or her influence to the project by becoming its champion. Having that person’s full support and participation—from the planning stage until the go-live date and beyond—is absolutely critical.

The **project owner**, who leads the implementation project, must understand the organization’s business processes to map them to MaaxFrame.

The person is designated as the **system administrator** manages MaaxFrame day to day and makes new functionality available. It’s also a good idea to have the administrator involved in the implementation. A technical background is not necessary, but may be helpful.

And to make sure that Salesforce CRM meets the needs of your end users, it is essential to involve key **power users** in the planning process.

### Find the Right MaaxFrame Administrator

Software as a service (SaaS) makes system administration much easier that it was with traditional software. Setting up the application, customizing and maintaining it, training users, and “turning on” the new features that become available with each release are all just a few clicks away.

The system administrator is one of the most important people when it comes to making your MaaxFrame implementation a success. The role of the administrator for a small business is not necessarily a full-time position. In the initial stages of the implementation, the role will require more concentrated time (about 50%). After go-live, managing MaaxFrame day to day will require much less time (10–25%).

Find the right person for the job and continue to invest in that person’s professional development. Here are some qualities to look for in an administrator:

* A solid understanding of your business processes
* Knowledge of the organizational structure and culture to help build relationships with key groups
* Excellent communication, motivational, and presentation skills
* The desire to be the voice of the user in communicating with management
* Analytical skills to respond to requested changes and identify customizations.

### Identify Your Key Players

It’s time to pick your team.

### Define Your Vision

Every successful project starts with a clear vision of where you want to be as a result of the project. Your vision will define a clear purpose for the initiative, drive ongoing commitment, and provide a way to measure and prove results.

It’s very important that your key executives are involved in defining this vision, that you document the vision, and that it is understood by everyone.

> Action: This vision should be a key component of future communication with your users.

### Define and Prioritize Your Goals

In addition to a clear destination, it also helps to have a plan that breaks down the journey into manageable steps. Setting your goals involves two key steps:

* Define the goals that support this vision
* Prioritize and document your requirements

#### Define Your Goals

Determine which concrete goals support your vision. Keep in mind that different groups within your organization are likely to have different goals. For example:

* Executives want to improve sales and track top performers or customer issues.
* Sales managers want better visibility into their pipelines and reports that summarize key information.
* Sales reps want to easily access the sales materials they need and cut down on administrative work.

MaaxFrame provides various reports to help measure whether you’ve reached your goals.

#### Prioritize Your Goals

Most people, and most organizations, want to take on more than they can handle at any one time. Clearly defining your goals and then prioritizing them will make it easier to decide what to put off, should that become necessary. Having some early “wins” is essential. When people experience the value of MaaxFrame first hand, they’re more likely to support adding additional features.

### Develop Your Rollout Plan

Customers typically take the approach of walking before they run. They focus first on a subset of the functionality available in MaaxFrame—allowing users to get comfortable with the application and adopt the most critical features—and then add more functionality during later phases.

It’s important to build your plan around the key areas you want to introduce first, then build your roadmap on the additional areas you will expand later.

Here’s an example of how one customer decided to approach their deployment, broken into three phases:

***Phase 1***: Import accounts and existing pipeline for general account and opportunity management
Introduce a Chatter group for MaaxFrame training and project communication

***Phase 2***: Upload existing leads and begin tracking leads from various sources
Introduce campaign management to track marketing initiatives

***Phase 3***: Begin tracking customer issues by onboarding the customer service team and using cases
Launch forecasting to the sales team

### Define Key Aspects of Your Process and Diagram the Process Flow

When defining your process, it helps to follow these steps:

* Make sure you understand key MaaxFrame terminology
* Identify key characteristics of your business processes
* Define and develop a visual overview of your own process
* Clarify what happens at each step—what inputs are needed, who does what, and how to measure the results
* Map your business processes to MaaxFrame

### Understand Key Salesforce CRM Terminology

* ***Leads*** – A lead is any person that may be interested in your products or services; for example, someone you met at a conference or who filled out a form on your website is a lead. If a rep qualifies a lead and decides to pursue it, the lead is “converted,” which automatically transforms it into three objects: an account, a contact, and an opportunity.

* ***Accounts*** - An account is an organization, individual, or company that you want to track in MaaxFrame. An account can include customers, competitors, partners, or any other entities that make sense for your business. An account record contains—or connects to—all information about your interactions with the company, such as in-progress and completed opportunities, your points of contact, and records of past interactions.

* ***Contacts*** - The contact object stores information about people who work at the companies represented by the account object. A contact record contains all relevant information about the person, such as phone numbers, titles, and role in a deal, and much more. With contacts, you can capture all the personal information you need to develop the relationships that are so important in sales.
When a sales rep converts a lead in MaaxFrame, the information in the lead is automatically transferred to the contact. As your engagement with the company widens and your reps meet more people, they can keep creating additional contacts associated with the corresponding account.

* ***Opportunities*** – The opportunity object contains the information for every deal you’re tracking, such as deal size and expected close date. The opportunity object is at the core of your sales process. By adding an opportunity, you build a “pipeline” you can use for forecasting.

* ***Activities*** – Activities consist of the tasks, events, calls, and emails that make it possible to track every customer interaction.

### Outline the Key Aspects of Your Sales Process

For most businesses, outlining their basic sales process includes gathering the following information:

* Generating leads – Where do leads come from? How do they get into MaaxFrame? What happens next? What information do you want to measure about leads?
* Optimizing lead flow – How do you manage open leads? How do you check for duplicates? How do you work through leads? How do you measure conversion and top performers?
* Closing deals – How do you manage the sales funnel? How can you measure top deals, closed business by month, and month-to-date trending?

### Create Your Process Overview

The goal of this step is to come up with a visual overview of your processes. Here’s an example of a sales process:
