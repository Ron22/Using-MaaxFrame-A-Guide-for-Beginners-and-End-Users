<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>One of the best investments you can make in your MaaxFrame success is to have a clear plan. Just as you wouldn’t build a house without a blueprint, you don’t want to start using MaaxFrame without a plan. A plan will help you to communicate with everyone, to do things in the right order, identify key resources, and keep a clear end date in mind.</p>
<p>As you plan and prepare to get MaaxFrame up and running, complete the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build your team</li>
<li>Define your company’s vision</li>
<li>Define and prioritize your goals</li>
<li>Develop your rollout plan</li>
<li>Define key aspects of your process and diagram the process flow</li>
<li>Map your process to MaaxFrame functionality</li>
<li>Decide which reports you need</li>
<li>Train your administrator</li>
<li>Communicate with your end users</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="build-your-team">Build Your Team</h3>
<p>To a small business with limited resources, the term “project team” may sound intimidating, but it doesn’t take a huge team to implement MaaxFrame. You just need to cover the following key roles (and the same person can cover more than one role):</p>
<ul>
<li>An executive sponsor</li>
<li>A project owner to get the application up and running</li>
<li>An administrator to manage MaaxFrame day to day</li>
<li>A power user who really knows your company’s business processes</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>executive sponsor</strong> lends his or her influence to the project by becoming its champion. Having that person’s full support and participation—from the planning stage until the go-live date and beyond—is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>The <strong>project owner</strong>, who leads the implementation project, must understand the organization’s business processes to map them to MaaxFrame.</p>
<p>The person is designated as the <strong>system administrator</strong> manages MaaxFrame day to day and makes new functionality available. It’s also a good idea to have the administrator involved in the implementation. A technical background is not necessary, but may be helpful.</p>
<p>And to make sure that Salesforce CRM meets the needs of your end users, it is essential to involve key <strong>power users</strong> in the planning process.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="find-the-right-maaxframe-administrator">Find the Right MaaxFrame Administrator</h3>
<p>Software as a service (SaaS) makes system administration much easier that it was with traditional software. Setting up the application, customizing and maintaining it, training users, and “turning on” the new features that become available with each release are all just a few clicks away.</p>
<p>The system administrator is one of the most important people when it comes to making your MaaxFrame implementation a success. The role of the administrator for a small business is not necessarily a full-time position. In the initial stages of the implementation, the role will require more concentrated time (about 50%). After go-live, managing MaaxFrame day to day will require much less time (10–25%).</p>
<p>Find the right person for the job and continue to invest in that person’s professional development. Here are some qualities to look for in an administrator:</p>
<ul>
<li>A solid understanding of your business processes</li>
<li>Knowledge of the organizational structure and culture to help build relationships with key groups</li>
<li>Excellent communication, motivational, and presentation skills</li>
<li>The desire to be the voice of the user in communicating with management</li>
<li>Analytical skills to respond to requested changes and identify customizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to take advantage of Premier Success &amp; Administration to assist with key tactical responsibilities. Through this service, our experts can help your team with administrative tasks and serve as an extension of MaaxFrame internal team.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="identify-your-key-players">Identify Your Key Players</h3>
<p>It’s time to pick your team.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="define-your-vision">Define Your Vision</h3>
<p>Every successful project starts with a clear vision of where you want to be as a result of the project. Your vision will define a clear purpose for the initiative, drive ongoing commitment, and provide a way to measure and prove results.</p>
<p>It’s very important that your key executives are involved in defining this vision, that you document the vision, and that it is understood by everyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Action: This vision should be a key component of future communication with your users.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="define-and-prioritize-your-goals">Define and Prioritize Your Goals</h3>
<p>In addition to a clear destination, it also helps to have a plan that breaks down the journey into manageable steps. Setting your goals involves two key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the goals that support this vision</li>
<li>Prioritize and document your requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="define-your-goals">Define Your Goals</h4>
<p>Determine which concrete goals support your vision. Keep in mind that different groups within your organization are likely to have different goals. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Executives want to improve sales and track top performers or customer issues.</li>
<li>Sales managers want better visibility into their pipelines and reports that summarize key information.</li>
<li>Sales reps want to easily access the sales materials they need and cut down on administrative work.</li>
</ul>
<p>MaaxFrame provides various reports to help measure whether you’ve reached your goals.</p>
<h4 id="prioritize-your-goals">Prioritize Your Goals</h4>
<p>Most people, and most organizations, want to take on more than they can handle at any one time. Clearly defining your goals and then prioritizing them will make it easier to decide what to put off, should that become necessary. Having some early “wins” is essential. When people experience the value of MaaxFrame first hand, they’re more likely to support adding additional features.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="develop-your-rollout-plan">Develop Your Rollout Plan</h3>
<p>Customers typically take the approach of walking before they run. They focus first on a subset of the functionality available in MaaxFrame—allowing users to get comfortable with the application and adopt the most critical features—and then add more functionality during later phases.</p>
<p>It’s important to build your plan around the key areas you want to introduce first, then build your roadmap on the additional areas you will expand later.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how one customer decided to approach their deployment, broken into three phases:</p>
<p><strong><em>Phase 1</em></strong>: Import accounts and existing pipeline for general account and opportunity management Introduce a Chatter group for MaaxFrame training and project communication</p>
<p><strong><em>Phase 2</em></strong>: Upload existing leads and begin tracking leads from various sources Introduce campaign management to track marketing initiatives</p>
<p><strong><em>Phase 3</em></strong>: Begin tracking customer issues by onboarding the customer service team and using cases Launch forecasting to the sales team</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="define-key-aspects-of-your-process-and-diagram-the-process-flow">Define Key Aspects of Your Process and Diagram the Process Flow</h3>
<p>When defining your process, it helps to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you understand key MaaxFrame terminology</li>
<li>Identify key characteristics of your business processes</li>
<li>Define and develop a visual overview of your own process</li>
<li>Clarify what happens at each step—what inputs are needed, who does what, and how to measure the results</li>
<li>Map your business processes to MaaxFrame</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="understand-key-salesforce-crm-terminology">Understand Key Salesforce CRM Terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Leads</em></strong> – A lead is any person that may be interested in your products or services; for example, someone you met at a conference or who filled out a form on your website is a lead. If a rep qualifies a lead and decides to pursue it, the lead is “converted,” which automatically transforms it into three objects: an account, a contact, and an opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Accounts</em></strong> - An account is an organization, individual, or company that you want to track in MaaxFrame. An account can include customers, competitors, partners, or any other entities that make sense for your business. An account record contains—or connects to—all information about your interactions with the company, such as in-progress and completed opportunities, your points of contact, and records of past interactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Contacts</em></strong> - The contact object stores information about people who work at the companies represented by the account object. A contact record contains all relevant information about the person, such as phone numbers, titles, and role in a deal, and much more. With contacts, you can capture all the personal information you need to develop the relationships that are so important in sales. When a sales rep converts a lead in MaaxFrame, the information in the lead is automatically transferred to the contact. As your engagement with the company widens and your reps meet more people, they can keep creating additional contacts associated with the corresponding account.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Opportunities</em></strong> – The opportunity object contains the information for every deal you’re tracking, such as deal size and expected close date. The opportunity object is at the core of your sales process. By adding an opportunity, you build a “pipeline” you can use for forecasting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Activities</em></strong> – Activities consist of the tasks, events, calls, and emails that make it possible to track every customer interaction.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="outline-the-key-aspects-of-your-sales-process">Outline the Key Aspects of Your Sales Process</h3>
<p>For most businesses, outlining their basic sales process includes gathering the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating leads – Where do leads come from? How do they get into MaaxFrame? What happens next? What information do you want to measure about leads?</li>
<li>Optimizing lead flow – How do you manage open leads? How do you check for duplicates? How do you work through leads? How do you measure conversion and top performers?</li>
<li>Closing deals – How do you manage the sales funnel? How can you measure top deals, closed business by month, and month-to-date trending?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="create-your-process-overview">Create Your Process Overview</h3>
<p>The goal of this step is to come up with a visual overview of your processes. Here’s an example of a sales process:</p>
<p>[! Sales Process]img/sales_process.jpg)</p>
<p>Discuss the sample process with your project team and modify it to fit your organization. If you don’t have a defined sales process, a CRM implementation is a good time to set one up.</p>
<p>To set up your own sales process: * Start at the point where a lead is qualified as an opportunity. * On a whiteboard, draw each step as you ideally want the information to flow.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="map-your-process-to-maaxframe-functionality">Map Your Process to MaaxFrame Functionality</h3>
<p>The next step is to map your ideal process to MaaxFrame and establish the names you give to your data elements and the fields in MaaxFrame. For example, you may call a customer “Company,” while the corresponding field in MaaxFrame is “Account.”</p>
<p>To start the mapping process, review the fields associated with the Opportunity process—which includes the fields for Leads, Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities—and answer the following questions: * Do you need all the fields? Review the fields and decide which can be removed. * Do you need to rename standard fields so they make more sense; for example, change “Account” to “Company”? * Do you need custom fields that are unique to your business?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="decide-which-drill-down-reports-you-need">Decide Which Drill Down Reports You Need</h3>
<p>Decide which reports you need to generate based on the goals you defined earlier. MaaxFrame provides dozens of standard reports with drill down feature. Here are a few of the most commonly used reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Account Revenue by Industry</em></strong>: Shows revenue accounts categorized by industry</li>
<li><strong><em>Account Owner</em></strong>: Who owns which account</li>
<li><strong><em>Lead by Status and Industry</em></strong>: Created leads in last six months categorized by lead status</li>
<li><strong><em>Leads with last activity &gt; 30 days</em></strong>: Which leads need attention</li>
<li><strong><em>Sales Forecas</em></strong>: Estimate of your sales for the forecast period</li>
<li><strong><em>Opportunity by Source</em></strong>: How effective are all opportunity sources</li>
<li><strong><em>Campaigns</em></strong>: Active</li>
<li><strong><em>Contact Distribution</em></strong>: Global Distribution of contacts</li>
<li><strong><em>Sales trend for current year</em></strong>: Total and average revenue per year</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of additional reports, navigate to the Reports tab in MaaxFrame; on the left side, you will see a list of report folders organized by function (CRM Reports, Adhoc Reports, etc.). Click into the folder to view these standard reports. You can modify these reports or create your own from scratch. Thinking about what information you want to capture is a critical step before you begin customizing the application. Remember: The system is only as good as the information you can pull into a report.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="train-your-administrator">Train Your Administrator</h3>
<p>Investing in your administrator is the best way to ensure success. MaaxFrame offers both virtual self-paced training with full support. The self-paced support are available with your licenses around the clock at no additional charge included in <a href="http://www.maaxframe.com/pricingbox.html">Dedicated Edition</a>. During the implementation, you may want to consider getting help from our certified managers. They can assist with all aspects of the implementation, and many customers find it useful to leverage managers’ expertise and technical skills.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="communicate-with-your-end-users">Communicate with Your End Users</h3>
<p>With clear goals set, you can now engage your users. User adoption is critical for MaaxFrame success.</p>
<p>You want the introduction of MaaxFrame to come as a surprise to users. As it, start building enthusiasm and keep your users updated as your go-live date approaches. For the highest impact, these communications should come from the executive sponsor. Here are some approaches that have worked for other customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build anticipation by enlisting the help of your marketing staff in treating the MaaxFrame implementation like a product launch.</li>
<li>Focus on two or three aspects of MaaxFrame that will make your users’ lives easier.</li>
<li>Reach out to users who seem particularly enthusiastic and give them a role in helping other users once you’re “live.”</li>
<li>Sponsor contests and offer incentives to help build excitement.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best ways to get people on board is to get them involved. Give them a voice and be sure to make changes based on their feedback. Then, communicate the difference their input made on the project’s launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommendation: Create a group to share information about your MaaxFrame deployment. You can consolidate all materials, training resources, and conversation into one central location. You can also share key milestones and achievements related to your MaaxFrame deployment. Make sure that your executive sponsor is engaged and posting updates and feedback to your users.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3 id="summary-and-checklist-prepare">Summary and Checklist: Prepare</h3>
<p>Careful preparation and planning will help make the remaining steps in implementing MaaxFrame go smoothly.</p>
<h1 id="setup-maaxframe">Setup MaaxFrame</h1>
<p>This section tells you how to take the next steps by outlining the key areas to begin setting up MaaxFrame, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company profile</li>
<li>User access and permissions</li>
<li>Customization</li>
<li>Adding users</li>
<li>Importing data</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="set-up-your-company-profile">Set Up Your Company Profile</h2>
<p>The company profile information determines basic settings related to time zones, language, and how the fiscal year is defined. You can leave the default settings as is; however, it’s important to know where to find and change this information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Company profile – These settings use your local time for setting the time zone, default language, and the default currency.</li>
<li>Fiscal years – The fiscal year definitions are used in reporting, opportunities, and forecasting. The default fiscal year setting is a 12-month calendar year, with the first day of the fiscal year starting on any first day of the month. However, you can choose custom fiscal year periods.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/company.PNG" />
</figure>
<hr />
<h2 id="establish-user-access-and-permissions">Establish User Access and Permissions</h2>
<p>There are some key components that determine users’ access to data as well as what they can do with the data they have access to.</p>
<h3 id="data-access">Data Access</h3>
<p>When setting up MaaxFrame for the first time, you need to make some decisions about who will have access to what data. In MaaxFrame, there are four ways to control data access:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Organization-wide defaults</em></strong> – Configure the baseline access users will have to your data.</li>
<li><strong><em>Role hierarchy</em></strong> – Determine the level of visibility users have to data.</li>
<li><strong><em>Sharing rules</em></strong> – Extend access to data if you’ve restricted access through your organization-wide defaults.</li>
<li><strong><em>Manual sharing</em></strong> – Provide the flexibility to allow record owners to manually give access to other users.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="organization-wide-defaults">Organization-Wide Defaults</h4>
<p>These settings, which determine the default level of data access for different types of information, are referred to as “organization wide defaults.” These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Private</em></strong> – Users can access (view and edit) their information and that of those below them in the role hierarchy.</li>
<li><strong><em>Public Read Only</em></strong> – Users can view all data, but can edit only their information as well as that of those below them in the role hierarchy</li>
<li><strong><em>Public Read Write</em></strong> – Users can view and edit all data</li>
</ul>
<p>For smaller organizations, we recommend granting at least Public Read Only access to create a collaborative working environment.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>To allow all users to see everyone’s accounts, but not everyone’s opportunities, set access for account records to Public Read Only and for opportunity records to Private.</li>
<li>To allow the operations team to calculate commissions, they need to see opportunities. However, you don’t want them to edit the opportunities. To allow read-only access, set opportunity records to Public Read Only.</li>
<li>To set up organization-wide-defaults, please refer to our techincal guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an overview of user access and permissions, view our Techincal Guide : Setup.</p>
<h4 id="role-hierarchy">Role Hierarchy</h4>
<p>The role hierarchy looks similar to an organization chart, but it has a different purpose. Because the role hierarchy is based on who needs to work with what data to do his or her job, role hierarchies usually have fewer layers and the people at the top are not necessarily those at the top of the org chart.</p>

<p>The person in the top role (i.e Admin) has full access (view ,edit and delete ) to his or her data as well as the data of anyone lower in the hierarchy. Two common ways to set up role hierarchy are by region or by product.</p>
<p>There are three basic steps to setting up a successful role hierarchy:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define the basic roles, such as sales representative, director of sales, and CEO. It’s not necessary to create individual roles for each title; the idea is to simply define a hierarchy that gives users in higher-level roles access to the information entered by users in the lower-level roles.</li>
<li>Build the role hierarchy based on how information should roll up for reporting and on who should see what data.</li>
<li>Assign individual users to the roles.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sharing-rules">Sharing Rules</h3>
<p>Sharing rules let you make automated exceptions to your organization-wide defaults for particular sets of users, so you can give them access to records they don’t own or can’t normally see. Sharing rules, like role hierarchies, are only used to give additional users access to records—they cannot be stricter than your organization-wide default settings.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/sharing_rules.PNG" />
</figure>
<h3 id="manual-sharing">Manual Sharing</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s impossible to define a consistent group of users who need access to a particular set of records. In those situations, record owners can use manual sharing to give read and edit permissions to users who would not normally have access to the record. Although manual sharing isn’t automated like sharing rules, it gives record owners the flexibility to share particular records with users that need to see them.</p>
<h4 id="permissions">Permissions</h4>
<p>Profiles control what users have permission to do with the data they have access to, and how they view the information.Please refer to our technical guide.</p>
<h4 id="understand-profiles">Understand Profiles</h4>
<p>A profile is a collection of settings and permissions that defines how users with particular profile access records, how they see their data, and what they can do within the application. For MaaxFrame Premium Editions, you can use the standard MaaxFrame profiles but you can’t create custom profiles. Even so, it’s important to understand profiles and how they work together with the organization-wide defaults and the role hierarchy. The most important profiles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Administrator – Can configure and customize the application</li>
<li>Standard User – Can run reports and create and edit records</li>
</ul>
<p>When you add users as you prepare to go live, you will assign one of these profiles to each user.</p>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
<p>When you sign on with MaaxFrame, it’s ready to use as is. But you can also easily modify MaaxFrame so that it’s an even better fit for your business and your users. In fact, the more you customize the application to fit your specific users, the more comfortable they’re likely to be—and customization can do great things to boost your adoption rates.</p>
<p>In this section, you’ll learn about customization and get links to step-by-step procedures for making MaaxFrame your own.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="use-customization-tips-tricks">Use Customization Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
<p>Customizing MaaxFrame is so easy that there’s a tendency to create lots of fields that end up not being used. For that reason, it’s important to take a step back before you dive in.</p>
<p>Here are the top five things to think about before starting to customize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Think before you build</em></strong> – Start with the end in mind by identifying your end goal. Think about what information you want to pull out of the system, and then make sure you have the fields to match. At the end of the day, MaaxFrame is only as good as what’s in your reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Ask for input</em></strong> – Talk to your users to find out what’s critical for them to know. Then capture that information to run your business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Seed and grow</em></strong> – Start with the basic fields you need and then identify new fields that could make your business run even better. This approach ensures you don’t turn off your users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Run reports</em></strong> – Run reports about one month after you go live to find out which fields are not being used. Use the opportunity to survey users about what could be improved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Make changes on the fly</em></strong> – In response to feedback, make changes immediately to gain instant credibility. Make sure you communicate any changes, because users don’t like it when anything that affects their work happens “magically.”</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="know-what-can-you-customize">Know What Can You Customize</h3>
<p>You can customize many different MaaxFrame components; however, most customers customize three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fields</li>
<li>Page layouts</li>
<li>Reports</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="customize-fields">Customize Fields</h4>
<p>Because fields hold the data you want to capture and report on, it’s important to make sure you have fields for important data elements and that those fields have names that make sense to your users. Here are common approaches to customizing fields:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/field.PNG" />
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Modify the standard MaaxFrame fields – MaaxFrame provides commonly used fields for standard records such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and leads.</li>
<li>For example, the Lead object has a standard field called “Lead Status,” which has existing values of “Attempted to Contact,” “Cold,” “Hot,” “Pre-Qualified,” “Warm,” and few more. You can easily add a new value called “Dukewarm.”</li>
<li>Create fields from scratch – If a standard MaaxFrame field that you need doesn’t already exist, you can easily create a custom field. For example, you can add a new picklist to capture “Lead Type” and track the main competitor in the sales cycle.</li>
<li>Do both! Combine standard fields and custom fields to create the best experience for your users.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="customize-page-layouts">Customize Page Layouts</h4>
<p>Page layouts define how fields—standard and custom—look to your users and which fields are required; that is, they can’t be saved unless the user enters a value. You’ll want to customize your layouts so that they’re attractive and easy to use. It may be tempting to create many required fields to force users to enter data; however, keep in mind that user satisfaction tends to suffer when there are too many required fields.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/layout.PNG" />
</figure>
<p>Here’s what you can do to customize page layouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary fields</li>
<li>Change field locations</li>
<li>Create new sections</li>
<li>Determine if filling in a field is required before saving</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="customize-reports">Customize Reports</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Being able to easily generate reports containing the information that’s most important to you is one of the great things about MaaxFrame. With a large number of standard reports available out of the box, you can be reporting in no time.</p></li>
<li><p>In the planning process, you determined what information you would need to pull from MaaxFrame based on your current business needs. Then you customized the application based on those needs.</p></li>
<li><p>After you add the custom fields to MaaxFrame, it’s time to re-evaluate if you have all the information you need to pull the proper reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/reports.PNG" />
</figure>
<p>Now you’re ready to start creating your reports. Here’s what you can do with reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize the standard reports to better fit your business needs.</li>
<li>Create custom reports from scratch and determine which fields they contain, how they’re laid out, sorting options, date ranges, and charting options.</li>
<li>Leverage pre-built dashboards that contain all the underlying reports tied to the dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="to-lead-or-not-to-lead">To Lead or Not to Lead?</h3>
<p>An important step in setting up MaaxFrame is to decide whether or not to use lead functionality. Leads are a critical part of the sales cycle of most businesses, and MaaxFrame includes a lot of very useful lead functionality, such as analyzing how leads convert or finding your best channels. Some companies decide not to use lead functionality because it requires an additional step to turn a prospect into an opportunity. What’s right for you depends on your business processes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/leads.PNG" />
</figure>
<h4 id="take-advantage-of-lead-functionality">Take Advantage of Lead Functionality</h4>
<p>Leads are unique among MaaxFrame records because they come with special functionality, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Lead Conversion</em></strong> – A benefit of using leads in MaaxFrame is that it creates a separate area in which you can keep information in any kind of format to track anyone who ever expressed interest. This approach keeps a clean distinction between leads and contacts, so you don’t have to worry about “dirty” data or duplicates. If you don’t use leads, you can’t run an analysis of how leads convert or the best channels for creating leads.</li>
<li><strong><em>Reports</em></strong> – Available reports show conversion rates, the time required to convert a lead, and lead channels that are the best performers when it comes to bringing in deals.</li>
<li><strong><em>Web-to-Lead</em></strong> – Getting leads from multiple channels is critical to any business. By using the Web-to-Lead functionality, you can easily create forms that capture leads from your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about leads, take a look at our tip sheet within the Help &amp; Training portal refer to our techical guide.</p>
<h3 id="capture-leads-from-your-website">Capture Leads from Your Website</h3>
<p>If you have decided to use leads, it makes sense to also evaluate the Web-to-Lead functionality. You probably have a website that lets prospects contact you te your product or service.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/lead_website.PNG" />
</figure>
<p>To make the most of your website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize MaaxFrame to use Web-to-Lead functionality to capture leads when prospects fill in a form.</li>
<li>Bring that information right into MaaxFrame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up this functionality is as simple as deciding which fields to include on the Web-to-Lead form, creating a URL as a landing page (such as a “thank you” page), and clicking a button to generate the HTML code. Your webmaster will jump for joy when you deliver HTML code that’s ready to deploy immediately.</p>
<h2 id="add-users">Add Users</h2>
<p>When MaaxFrame is set up the way you want it, you’re ready to add users.</p>
<p>Adding users is a fairly easy task. Earlier we covered profiles and setting up your organization’s role hierarchy. When you add users, you associate actual users with those profiles within your role hierarchy, so users can log in and access the data that’s appropriate for them.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/add_users.PNG" />
</figure>
<p>Adding users serves three important purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you add users, you can import data and automatically associate that data with the correct users.</li>
<li>By associating roles and profiles with all users, you can determine how they see data, what they can do in the application, and how their data rolls up.</li>
<li>When you add a user, MaaxFrame uses that user’s record to generate an invitation to log into the application.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: If you want to notify users to reset password, be sure to “Reset New password” button when you go through the process of adding users. And then You can edit the user records and generate usernames and passwords whenever you’re ready for users to actually log in.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="import-data">Import Data</h2>
<p>The final task before you’re ready to go live is to import your data into MaaxFrame. To help you, MaaxFrame has wizards to walk you through the process and provide some tips along the way. When the import is complete, you’re can start to train your users and announce that MaaxFrame is ready for business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This import step is probably the most complex task in any other platforms bur not in MaaxFrame , it’s ease to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most companies already have account and contact information stored somewhere—usually in Act!, Goldmine, or Microsoft Outlook, as well as in spreadsheets, on sticky notes, or in the heads of their sales reps. Getting that information out of Outlook and off the sticky notes and into your organization’s knowledge base is one of the most important steps in the implementation process.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/import.PNG" />
</figure>
<p>Although you could collect all these resources and enter them one by one, it’s obviously not efficient to enter hundreds or even thousands of records by hand. MaaxFrame provides a step-by-step data import wizard that walks you through the process of importing leads, accounts, and contacts.</p>
<h3 id="prepare-to-import-your-data">Prepare to Import Your Data</h3>
<p>Best practices for importing your data include having a well thought-out plan, properly preparing the data, and doing a test run. Planning your data import includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying your data sources data sources: Is your data in spreadsheets?</li>
<li>Listing fields in your current data records.</li>
<li>Mapping your current fields to the MaaxFrame fields.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prepare-your-data">Prepare Your Data</h3>
<p>We suggest you “scrub” your data before importing it into MaaxFrame because starting with clean data really pays off. Remember: “Garbage in, garbage out.”</p>
<p>Here are some tips for preparing your data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MaaxFrame import wizard was designed to work with Microsoft Excel. If necessary, export your data from any other data sources to Excel first.</li>
<li>Now is a good time to standardize naming and clean up your data. For example, set standards for company names (such as International Business Machines instead of IBM) or the way countries are listed (USA instead of United States).</li>
<li>Take time to weed out “dirty” data and de-duplicate people who may be in the system multiple times.</li>
<li>Review your Excel file to see if you missed any critical data elements for which you haven’t yet created custom fields. For example, if your sales reps are tracking the number of employees at each account, you’ll need a field to store that information in MaaxFrame.</li>
<li>Map your data columns to the MaaxFrame field names. For example, the Company field in Microsoft typically maps to the Account field in MaaxFrame. Consider renaming the column headers in your Excel file so they match the field names in MaaxFrame exactly. This step will simplify the mapping step in the wizard.</li>
<li>Wherever possible, assign the correct owners to records. If you don’t have all the records assigned, the default owner is the administrator who performs the import.</li>
<li>Now start importing your data.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/import1.PNG" />
</figure>
<p>Test the import: Test a small sample—approximately 5 to 10 records—before going ahead with the full import. When you analyze the results of your test, try this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a custom report or custom view that lets you see at a glance whether the data is laid out correctly.</li>
<li>Open a record and compare it against the import file. Confirm that the record’s fields show what you want them to show.</li>
<li>Validate the test results with selected stakeholders or power users.</li>
<li>Make changes to the import file or make changes to MaaxFrame based on the test results. For example, data could import incorrectly because it was mapped to the wrong field.</li>
<li>Delete the test records and test again after making your changes. Repeat this process until you’re sure the data was imported accurately and that it is displayed correctly in the reports and views your users will see.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="import-your-final-data">Import Your Final Data</h3>
<p>Once your test results meet your expectations, you’re ready to import your file or files. Here are a few suggestions for importing data: * Consider importing data during non-working hours – If the system is live for some groups before others, this approach helps avoid confusion. * Give yourself some cushion for error – Don’t try to import your data the day before sales training, for example. * Validate your data – Run key reports and display important screens to make sure all the data was imported into the fields where it belongs and in the format you want.</p>
<h1 id="home">Home</h1>
<p>MaaxFrame Home page houses the dashboard and activity stream which allows users to view pertinent record information via various dashlets and activity stream posts. Every user in MaaxFrame can configure their dashlets based on the display options and filters available from their dashboard. User’s can also personalize their activity stream to only view posts specific to records that are important to them. This documentation will go over the basics of the Home page as well as the various options available to customize the Home page to best fit your individual needs.</p>

<li><p>Searching Leads</p></li>
<li><p>The Leads list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Leads list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire MaaxFrame database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that MaaxFrame automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word “smith” in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the Search documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leads List View</p></li>
<li><p>The Leads list view displays all lead records meeting the current search criteria to which your user has access. You can view the basic details of each lead within the field columns. Please note that you will only be able to see lead records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the Team Management and Role Management documentation in the Administration guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Leads Record View</p></li>
<li><p>The Leads record view displays thorough lead information including all lead fields. Beneath the fields you can toggle between viewing a lead’s subpanels of related records (Campaigns) and the lead’s activity stream. The record view can be reached by clciking a lead record’s link from anywhere in the application including from the Leads list view.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to view a lead record according to your team membership, user type, and role restrictions. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the Team Management and Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the Studio documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deleting Records</p></li>
<li><p>If a lead record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization’s MaaxFrame instance, it may be deleted from either the Leads record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting lead records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete leads in MaaxFrame may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Delete options.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Converting Leads</p></li>
<li><p>MaaxFrame enables you to convert leads into contacts as you determine they qualify for your organization’s definition of a contact (e.g. after an evaluation/qualification process or upon entering into business with the individual). When the lead is converted, a new contact record is created in MaaxFrame with a relationship to the original lead record. The Convert Lead page also gives you the option to create an account and opportunity record.</p></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/Leads5.PNG" />
</figure>
<ul>
<li><p>Exporting Leads</p></li>
<li><p>MaaxFrame’s Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected leads to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Lead data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of lead records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Leads may be exported from the Leads list view by selecting “Export Selected” from the More menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for leads and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in MaaxFrame, please refer to the Export documentation.</p>

<p>Please note that your ability to export leads from MaaxFrame may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the Role Management documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Export option.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Viewing Lead Change Logs</p></li>
<li><p>Changes made to each lead record are tracked over time, and users are able to view the history of changes via the change log in each lead’s record view. To view the change log, navigate to a lead in record view and select “Logs” inside the Actions menu. For more information on designating for audit, please refer to the documentation in the Administration guide.</p></li>
